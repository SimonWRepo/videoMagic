# Video Magic
This is a computer vision project designed to overlay images of "magic" based on hand movements. It is a work in progress.

Snapping your fingers and holding them in the ending position created an animated flame on the thumb tip

Putting your hands together and then quickly pulling them apart will create lightning between the two hands

More upcoming

A lot of the code also need refactoring and cleaning up
